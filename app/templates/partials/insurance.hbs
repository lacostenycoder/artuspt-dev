    Unfortunately we do not accept HMOâ€™s, GHI, HIP or Medicaid.

    We will thoroughly verify your insurance benefits and inform you of all out-of-

    pocket costs prior to your first visit.

    For those without insurance coverage, we offer a self-pay rate of $150.00 per

    visit with package deals available.

    We accept payment via cash, check, American Express, Visa, MasterCard, debit

    card, Health Savings Account (HSA) or Flex Spending Account (FSA).

    <h3>Prescriptions/Referrals</h3>
    <p>
A prescription/referral is not legally required in the state of New York to receive
physical therapy services. However, some insurance companies may require a
patient to have a referral before they will pay for physical therapy. In those
instances we will notify you before your first visit so that you will not incur any
unexpected charges.

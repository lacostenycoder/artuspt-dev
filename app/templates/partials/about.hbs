        <p>At Artus Physical Therapy we do not use a simple protocol approach to our patient’s rehabilitation.  Our goal is to look deeper at the underlying causes of the problem, so the condition can be properly treated and resolved without recurrence.  This approach looks at the whole body and requires more time and clinical skill.  We spend 45 minutes one-on-one with our patients.  We use hands on treatment techniques and never leave our patients on a hot pack or on their own to do rote gym exercise.</p>
